# Smart Greenhouse
The embedded system to be developed contains two sensing modules that collect information from temperature and brightness of an environment. This same system performs two procedures for processing independent data, which uses temperature and luminosity information to identify whether the system monitored is in an ideal condition. The monitored environment is an automated and intelligent greenhouse, composed of a mechanical arrangement (greenhouse) and an intelligent embedded system with connectivity, which will perform the control and automation of vegetable cultivation inside the greenhouse.

This system was developed with C++ and FreeRTOS.
